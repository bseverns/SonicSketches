/* This section of code will let you add sound to your project

We are giving the notes names (like C, D, E, etc...) and values
This lets us decide what the notes will be ahead of time.

The values can be any whole number between 100 and 4000
(high number here = high note later)

We've given you an example set up, but we want you to play around
with it and to get comfortable changing the code as you see fit */
